# Color Poll

A tiny site for classroom color responses.

- `index.html`: 4 big color buttons
- `color.html`: fills the screen with the chosen color (`?c=<hex-or-name>`)

## Customize colors

Edit the four links in `index.html`. Use named colors (`red`) or hex (`#e11d48`), but URL-encode `#` as `%23`.

## Fullscreen

On the color screen, tap **Fullscreen** to hide browser UI (supported on most phones after a tap).
